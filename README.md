# VR360Authoring

This project aims at providing an immersive authoring tool for composing interactive 360-degree videos.

It is being developed using Unity 3D and C#. 

Currently, our tool provides a player for playing interactive 360-degree videos following the model described in the paper "An Authoring Model for Interactive 360 videos" accepted for publication "In Proceedings of ICME 2020 Workshop: Tools for Creating XR Media Experiences, London, UK, 03 2020".

abstract={The recent availability of consumer-level head-mounted displays and
omnidirectional cameras has been driving an explosion of 360 video content.
Transforming the original recorded 360 video content in meaningful
interactive applications that support viewers in tasks such as learning,
entertainment, and training tasks, however, is not trivial and requires new
tools. Based on real-world scenarios for 360 interactive videos, in this
paper, we gather a set of requirements and propose an authoring model to
support authors in the process of reasoning and creating 360-degree
interactive video presentations. As a case study, we implement different
interactive 360 applications showing the expressiveness and completeness of
the model in the scope of the target scenarios.},

## Preview Video

The video bellow shows an interactive 360-degree video composed using the model we propose. In this video, a "mirror" of the stage is shown on the bottom of the screen when the user is not looking at the stage. Moreover, it has a spatial audio that gives the user the impression that it is coming from the stage.
